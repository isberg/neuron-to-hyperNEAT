We saw how we could reduce the number of lines of code using vector operations and how by showing the weights and bias in a clever way could make the neuron calculate the function we wanted in a few cases. We also managed to connect multiple neurons and make the network calculate the `XOR` of 2 inputs, something not possible with a single neuron.\n",
